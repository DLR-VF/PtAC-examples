# PtAC Examples

PtAC is a Python package that allows users to automatically compute public transport
accessibilities for the Sustainable Development Goal 11.2. monitored by the proportion
of the population that has convenient access to public transport.
Users can calculate accessibilities from population points to public transit stops
based on maximum distance or - if defined - two different transit systems: low- and high-capacity.

This repository contains usage examples of accessibility module as well as population
module along with the necessary datasets to demonstrate the features of PtAC.
You can find all the examples on
[notebooks](https://github.com/DLR-VF/PtAC-examples/tree/master/notebooks) folder.
